For increased security and efficiency, Cryptowerk processes these hashes into bundles and generates a \\u201Chash of hashes\\u201D (super-hash) which then are stored in the blockchains. For each of the hashes received, Cryptowerk returns a \\u201CSeal\\u201D back to you. The data is now successfully \\u201Csealed\\u201D.
