Cryptowerk stores hashes (in fact a hash of hashes, called “super-hash”) into blockchains – it does not store original customer data into blockchains. This provides the highest possible security, efficiency, and ease of implementation.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To submit information to Cryptowerk, the requester hashes any digital asset such as a performed transaction or file and send it to Cryptowerk’s server via a REST API.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Once Cryptowerk receives the hash, a ticket number is sent back to the customer which confirms receipt. Cryptowerk bundles the collected hashes and creates a single super-hash. This super-hash is then written into the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain. Cryptowerk writes by default into the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain. Once a blockchain confirms a particular transaction, Cryptowerk returns to the customer one Seal for each original hash on demand. Seals allow customers to demonstrate irrefutable proof of existence and authenticity directly in respective blockchains. At any later date the customer can verify the integrity of their data directly by querying the blockchains to which their hashes were written.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`What can Cryptowerk Horizon Do for my Business?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`At the highest level, Cryptowerk Horizon gives organizations confidence that their data and digital assets haven’t been altered or tampered with since their original creation, or alternatively alerts them if the current data no longer matches the original data. This enables many scenarios for exchanging and securing data, both within one organization and among many organizations.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Key capabilities of Cryptowerk Horizon include:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Scalability: Seal and verify up to 1 million digital assets per second.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Reduced Cost: Cryptowerk charges based on the number of transactions at a cost less than 100x the typical cost of public blockchain transactions.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Secure: No sensitive data is transferred to Cryptowerk, only hashes or digital fingerprints are written to the blockchain.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Maximized level of trust: Cryptowerk writes as a standard to Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain, maximizing the number of decentralized nodes.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Interoperability: Customers can choose specific blockchains from our set of blockchain adaprters and can easily migrate from one blockchain to another.

Those applications can be proprietary, commercial, or open source. Customers don’t have access to the underlying Cryptowerk Seal code, but rather write to the API based on our easy-to-use documentation.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Does Cryptowerk has its own blockchain?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`No. Cryptowerk doesn’t have its own blockchain. One of Cryptowerk’s web services are the blockchain adapters. These adapters can connect to any blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) by customer request. This service makes Cryptowerk’s technology interoperable, where system can easily be migrated from one blockchain to another. The API allows users to extend or switch to other blockchains by request. If you do not see the chain you would like to use Cryptowerk’s service with, please contact our support team at support@cryptowerk.com.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`What blockchains does Cryptowerk Horizon support?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The standard Cryptowerk Horizon subscription offering supports sealing into Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain by default. For custom configurations, Cryptowerk also supports the most popular and widely used blockchains and distributed ledgers, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Multichain, SAP Blockchain-as-a-Service, Hedera Hashgraph, and many others. We are continually adding support for additional blockchains and can support other blockchains by customer request.
